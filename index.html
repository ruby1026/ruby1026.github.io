            <span>My pet name is <em>Coco</em>. </span>
            His breed is <a href="https://art.illinois.edu/" target=" blank"> Poodle </a>. 
            Sometimes he is very quiet and he can sleep in my arm. Sometimes he is very <strong>NOISY</strong>
            that even my neighbours can hear his sound. At that time, I will take him for a walk, 
            which is one of his favourite activities. Another activity that can make him excited is eating! 
            He eats fast and clean. What a good boy!

            Here are some photos of <em>Coco</em>. Isn't he cute? 
            He is also very smart. He can shake hands and turn around when you give him food. He can also 
            follow your command to seat and lay flat. He braks loudly and run very fast. His eyes look like two black pearls and he has curly hairs.
            I enjoy staying with him and I <strong>MISS</strong> him very much!</p>
